This project is part of the **Machine Learning for Fluid Dynamics (MLFD)** course  
at the **von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics**, within the  
🌬️ **Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics Department**.

The main goal is to reconstruct the flow field behind a floating wind turbine  
based on experimental PIV data, using **Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)**.

## 🔍 Overview

This code allows you to:

- Load processed PIV experimental data  
- Interpolate velocity magnitude using RBFs  
- Compute vorticity fields from RBF derivatives  
- Perform parametric studies on:
  - the penalization parameter \( \alpha \)
  - the RBF width \( \varepsilon \)
